        <h1>Our Goals</h1>
        <p>
          TRUE CRIMESTOPPERS has an overarching goal to strengthen guardrails around democracy that was threatened in America by Donald Trump recently.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is realistic because his threat manifested from a critical historical fault in the way society attempts but fails to prevent crime that has never before been exposed or considered, but TRUE CRIMESTOPPERS remedies it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Donald Trump defeated all the existing guardrails, including the rule of law, but  was finally beaten by democracy’s ultimate guardrail at the ballot box.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the threat remains existential as Donald Trump did not act alone. He was enabled by a base that is dissatisfied with the inequity and corruption in American politics and a wealthy oligarchy who took advantage of the opportunity to subvert his transactional turpitude to benefit their self-interests. But you can’t successfully fight corruption with corruption and this has left the American people bereft.
        </p>
        <p>
          These divergent circumstances presented as a perfect storm for a rising demagogue to threaten democracy that the founding fathers foretold, but could not prevent.
        </p>
        <p>
          Donald Trump has now provided a comprehensive roadmap that will help new lawmakers to forge new institutional guardrails that better represent the people in a more equitable democracy.
        </p>
        <p>
          TRUE CRIMESTOPPERS can assist this process with it’s remedy that not only exposes the fault in democracy that enabled Donald Trump’s threat and would have earlier prevented it, but it includes the people in its remedy for the first time in the history of democracy to bolster an ineffective political system that leaves so many people out, and provides the means to truly prevent the moral turpitude, crime and corruption causing the dissatisfaction and inequity.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is one single overriding feature of Donald Trump’s threat that most enabled him; the criminal “code of silence” that protects all criminals and is reinforced by intimidatory threat and fear of retaliation.
        </p>
        <p>
          TRUE CRIMESTOPPERS exposes the cause of this threat that has never before been considered and it’s remedy overcomes the silence and the resultant threat of retaliation.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are myriad attempts at overcoming the silence but Donald Trump has demonstrated how difficult it is when deploying inequitable wealth and power to keep the offending in darkness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here TRUE CRIMESTOPPERS acknowledges the lone voice and courage of Jessica Denson in America for shining a light on this darkness enveloping millions of innocent victims, worldwide.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the supporters of George Floyd in America who got so close to exposing the fault before they themselves were eventually silenced.
        </p>
        <p>
          TRUE CRIMESTOPPERS not only has the comprehensive remedy to their divergent issues that impact the victims of all crime, but the same comprehensive remedy to save democracy itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          TRUE CRIMESTOPPERS remedies this fault with The Responsibility Contract that prevents crime by uniting peoples and communities that might otherwise be divided, in a common goal to not only prevent crime and build economic wealth, but also build social capital that will equally help strengthen democracy.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Responsibility Contract also provides the additional benefit of reforming policing, an institution that is regularly in the crosshairs of political reform, whether it be defunding or reimagining, neither has satisfied the reforms needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Responsibility Contract is a renegotiation of the existing social contract around crime prevention that does not work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Successful crime prevention outcomes together with building social capital and reforming the policing and the criminal justice institutions will ensure TRUE CRIMESTOPPERS achieves its overarching goal to strengthen democracy.
