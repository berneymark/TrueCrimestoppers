        <h1>The Responsibility Contract</h1>
        <p>
          Intervention is the most effective way to prevent real-time criminal offending. Early intervention on precursor offending and antisocial behaviour is critical to prevent it from escalating into more serious criminal offending. This is the goal of the Responsibility Contract.

            “I agree with the rule of law and all other social contracts. I agree they maintain social order and keep people and communities safe. I agree not to offend against them and, if I do, I agree I can be warned by anyone who has knowledge of my offending, and I agree to stop. If I offend and ignore a warning, I agree my offending can be formally reported to an appropriate authority without fear or threat of retaliation. If I have knowledge of offending, I agree I can warn the offender and if my warning is not heeded, I agree I can formally report the offending to an appropriate authority.”

          The Responsibility Contract was created and designed to be a crime prevention method by the people, for the people. The goal of this social contract is to overcome the code of silence that is caused by the punitive policing system. It enables people to intervene on known offending for the sole purpose of preventing it, rather than prosecuting criminals as a reaction to the crime that has already happened.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is what the Responsibility Contract does, and in its success, it proves the status quo is faulted where the criminal “code of silence”, caused by policing, is directly responsible for escalating crime and pervasive antisocial behaviour that impacts our quality of life and contributes significantly to a failing economy.
