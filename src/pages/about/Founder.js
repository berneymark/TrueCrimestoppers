              In the 1990's, I questioned what I believed to be a faulted international best practice to prevent theft and fraud in the workplace, to establish The Responsibility Contract that prevented previous $multi-million losses and symptomatic job redundancies, before the best international practice was dogmatically reinstated by the established order and the losses returned. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I stood by my newly found crime prevention solution, over my chosen professions in policing and private security management, eventually being forced out by those with dogmatic institutionalized adherence to the policing ideology that underpins security management. It was an irresistible force against a lone voice. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I accepted that this was as much due to fear of change as it was due to self-interest in protecting a preeminent commercial position in that quickly growing industry built on fear. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I continued my promotion of The Responsibility Contract from outside these realms into my father’s profession as a house painter in the building industry. 
            </p>
            <p>
              With little responsibility and plenty of time to reflect and continue important research and development of The Responsibility Contract it gave me the flexibility to leave at short notice to pioneer it as a new innovative remedy to what continues to this day to remain a failed international crime prevention method.

            </p>
            <p>
              From the planks and ladders of house painting, I was able to promote it as a new innovative, successful,  alternative crime and corruption method to many domestic and international parties and organizations where it was unanimously  approved but unable to attract a “first to get their feet wet” pioneer of a new innovative idea to challenge policing, one of society’s longest standing and most trusted institutions.
            </p>
            <p>
              I understood this as it represented a societal change in attitude but I equally understood that the fault incurred humungous unnecessary fiscal and social costs to society. Inevitably, the unanimous approbation  promised to adopt The Responsibility Contract once I had it “up and running”. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Here is a sample of those I proposed it to and received a promise of later support. 
            </p>
            
            <h2>In Closing...</h2>
            <p>
              I understand the dilemma and difficulty of change, particularly a complete societal reversal of long accepted conventions that stem from a previously unknown fault in one of society’s most longstanding, trusted institutions, policing.
            </p>
            <p>
              But the fact remains that the fault exists and will not go away by ignoring it.
            </p>
            <p>
              I founded The Responsibility Contract as its only remedy, there may be another that I am unaware of. However, in the absence of another solution, I would now propose The Responsibility Contract to society at large for public discussion and deliberation, to reinforce its efficacy to the leaders of the entities and organizations above who represent you and who are awaiting your direction on such social change.
            </p>
            <p>
              For me the choice is simple.
            </p>
            <p>
              Continue to tolerate crime and corruption, incurring huge unnecessary fiscal and social costs, simply because we cannot prevent it. Or adopt change that can prevent crime and corruption to save the debilitating fiscal and social costs to society.
