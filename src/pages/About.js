          <p>
            The principal of True Crimestoppers, Kevin Boyle, was a policeman in
            New Zealand in the 1970's abd a security advisor to New Zealand
            public companies throughough the 1980's to 1990's.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a security manager, he learned that the policing ideaology
            transferred into the proprietary management role did not prevent
            repetitive internal offending and appeared to exacerbate it.
            Research in the field founded The Responsibility Contract, a social
            contract needed to overcome the obstructive criminal "code of
            silence" caused by the policing ideaology, which opened the
            floodgates to coalface information about offending to enable
            intervention and prevention outcomes, saving previous losses
            totalling multi millions.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Responsibility Contract now underpins True Crimestoppers to not
            only access real time coalface information about existing
            information to stop it, as opposed to prosecuting it as a first
            response, but it is direct witness to precursor anti-social and
            potential criminal behaviours and can intervene to stop it
            manifesting into more serious behaviour and offending.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although achieving unprecendted success in the 1990's we recognise
            The Responsibility Contract was before its time as society was not
            ready to challenge policing, its long standing most trusted
            institution. But it is now compelling with a proliferation of
            unbated crime, particularly youth, gang and firearm offending
            seriously depleting economic resources and impacting the quality of
            life of New Zealanders, we believe it society is ready to adopt a
            solution that prevents crime by including everyone in a common
            cause, not just policing.
